  Summary: DiffusionDriveV2 enhances diffusion-based trajectory planning by combining truncated diffusion modeling with reinforcement learning. It uses scale-adaptive multiplicative noise to promote broad exploration, and designs intra-anchor GRPO to optimize samples within the same intention anchor plus inter-anchor truncated GRPO to compare advantages across anchors in a controlled way, suppressing low-quality modes while preserving multimodal, intention-diverse trajectories.

  Summary: SimScale is a scalable real-world–conditioned simulation framework that augments driving logs with massive, diverse, safety-critical scenarios. It uses neural rendering with a reactive environment to generate multi-view observations along perturbed ego trajectories, then synthesizes pseudo-expert trajectories for those new states; policies are cotrained on both real and simulated data, yielding improved robustness and generalization that scale with simulation data volume.

- **LAP**: LAP: Fast Latent Diffusion Planner with Fine-Grained Feature Distillation for Autonomous Driving [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00470)] [[Code](https://github.com/jhz1192/Latent-Planner)]
  
  Summary: LAP is a latent-space diffusion planner that decouples high-level driving intents from low-level kinematics using a VAE-learned latent representation. Trajectories are generated via diffusion in this latent space, while a fine-grained feature distillation mechanism tightly fuses the latent planner with vectorized scene context, enabling high-quality, multimodal plans in as few as a single denoising step and significantly reducing inference latency.

  Summary: DiffRefiner adopts a two-stage coarse-to-fine trajectory planning framework where a transformer-based proposal decoder first regresses coarse trajectories from sensor inputs using predefined anchors, and a diffusion refiner then iteratively denoises and refines these proposals. A fine-grained denoising decoder with semantic interaction improves scene compliance, yielding more accurate and environment-aligned trajectories.

The model is pretrained on QA and trajectory data to acquire driving knowledge, then supervised with mixed fast-answering and CoT-style slow-thinking data, and finally optimized with an Adaptive Think Reward and GRPO to learn when CoT reasoning improves trajectory quality versus when it is unnecessary.
